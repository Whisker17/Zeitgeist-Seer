## Bringing the Seer Program online
> ## 先知计划即将上线

The Seer Program is here! We have been hard at work behind the scenes creating the infrastructure that will support the Zeitgeist Seer Program and are happy to announce that we are ready to move on to the initial stages of on boarding and opening the program up for participation.
> 先知计划来啦！我们一直在幕后为 Zeitgeist 先知计划的基础设施而努力工作，现在，我们很高兴地宣布，我们已经为先知计划的启动做好准备，社区成员们即将可以参与到先知计划的初始阶段。

Starting with a blank slate, we have designed, planned, and created everything that you see in the program today. We are extremely excited to start on boarding and building a community that matches our goals and visions. At the time of this writing, we have on boarded our first few titled Seers, held our first community call, released our initial Seer Tasks, and set the building blocks needed to allow the Seer Program to evolve and grow in a direction that follows our vision.
> 我们从零开始设计、规划和创建了您如今能在先知计划中能看到的一切。我们非常高兴可以开始建设一个拥有着共同目标和愿景的社区。在撰写本文时，我们已经发展了社区的第一批先知，并且我们举行了第一次社区电话会议，在会议中，我们发布了先知计划初始阶段的任务，并且规划了必要的社区构建模块，以便让先知计划朝着我们共同的愿景发展和成长。

We are also starting our first major event, The Vanguard Initiative. 
> 同时，我们将开启第一个重大活动，即先锋计划。

The Vanguard initiative is a unique opportunity for selected applicants to put their best foot forward and contribute to the growth of the Seer Program right from the very beginning. In order to be eligible for the rewards attached to this initiative a program participant must be fully on boarded, have received the Seer title, and have been making active contributions towards the program.
> 先锋计划为被选中的申请者提供了一个独特的机会，让他们从一开始就可以全力以赴地为先知计划的发展做出贡献。为了有资格获得先锋计划的相关奖励，参与者们必须全心投入，获得 “先知（Seer）” 称号，并且一直为先知计划做出积极贡献。

There is still a lot to do, and always will be with an evolving program such as the Seer Program. Our next steps will be to create, implement, and test systems embedded throughout the program that are designed to engage members and encourage ideal behaviour. Once we are satisfied with the state of the early stages of the program, we will be opening up to the greater public and starting the program in earnest.

> 现在，一切才刚刚开始，我们仍然有很多事情要去做，而且随着 Zeitgeist 的不断发展，像先知计划这样的计划还会有很多。我们的下一步将是创建、实施和测试嵌入在整个计划中的系统，这旨在吸引更多的人加入先知计划并且鼓励更多有创意的行为，一旦我们对项目的早期计划感到满意，我们将向更多的公众开放，并真正启动先知计划。
