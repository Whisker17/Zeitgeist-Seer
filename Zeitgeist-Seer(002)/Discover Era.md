## Discovery Era
> ## 探索时代

The Discovery Era is the first Era of the Zeitgeist Seer Program. As we move forward with the launch of the program we want to build a community that fosters collaboration and networking. The Discovery Era will focus on that goal throughout its timeline. There will be an onboarding process perpetually running throughout the program, but in this Era there will also be a special onboarding  process called the 'Vanguard Initiative'.
> 探索时代是 Zeitgeist 先知计划的第一个时代。随着该计划的启动，我们希望建立一个促进协作和网络化的社区。探索时代将在其整个生命周期中专注于该目标。在整个计划中将有一个永久性的入职流程，在这个时代中，还将有一个特殊的入职流程，称为“先锋计划”。

During the Vanguard Initiative we will be focusing on targeting select groups of applicants for invitation to the program. These early members will have a unique opportunity to help shape the Seer Program right from the start, and set the standard that will continue throughout the rest of the program. At the conclusion of the Vanguard Initiative, exemplary members who participated in the initiative will be eligible to receive a limited edition NFT reward along with the Vanguard title.
> 在先锋计划期间，我们将针对特定的申请人群体，邀请他们参加该项目。这些早期成员将有一个独特的机会从一开始就帮助建设先知计划，并制定贯穿该计划其余部分的标准。在先锋计划结束时，参与该计划的楷模成员将有资格获得限量版 NFT 奖励以及先锋称号。


After the conclusion of the Vanguard Initiative the goals of the Discovery Era will shift towards populating the program by engaging and informing the greater public about the Seer Program. This will mark the beginning of the Seer Program's full vision of a community built around networking, collaboration, and building within the Zeitgeist ecosystem.

> 先锋计划结束后，探索时代的目标将转向通过让更多的公众参与并了解先知计划来充实该计划。这将标志着先知计划的愿景将全面开始，即在 Zeitgeist 生态系统中建立一个围绕网络、协作和建设的社区。
